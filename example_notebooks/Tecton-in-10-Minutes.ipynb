Generate training data using a FeatureService\n\nüîë **Concept: FeatureServices**\n\nA FeatureService is a set of features that have been grouped together for use in training and serving. Typically, each deployed model will have one FeatureService to serve features. One Tecton FeatureService can be used  for both generating training data sets and for serving feature values for batch and real-time predictions.\n\nThese commands do two things:\n1. *Load a set of sample events* - The index of a training set, the timestamps for prediction, and the labels. This would be created by your data scientists.\n2. *Pass those events to a FeatureService* - Tecton uses the index and the timestamp of the events to calculate the values for all features in the training data\n\nNote: These queries may take a few minutes to run."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Load a set of sample events from your Tecton environment:\nevents = tecton.get_virtual_data_source('sample_events_for_models')\nevents.preview()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Generate training data using a Tecton FeatureService: \nfs = tecton.get_feature_service('ctr_prediction_service')\ntraining_data = fs.get_feature_dataframe(events.dataframe())\ndisplay(training_data.to_spark())"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó If you received an error in running these commands, you may need to update your Feature Store.

That is, the system automatically makes sure that all feature values are accurate with respect to the prediction timestamp and there is no target leakage. \n* This training set is created from a combination of features using batch and streaming data - traditionally a difficult undertaking. You can learn more about the different features in this FeatureService in the Tecton Web UI. \n* Training set generation was done with two lines of code. It is quick to begin building your models, defining your model metrics, and iterating on different algorithms when it is easy to access the features."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 2. Serve features at prediction through a productionized API\n\nLet's assume the model created from the above training set was put into production. To use that model to make a prediction, it needs to be fed up-to-date data at the `ad_id` and `user_uuid` level (the index of the training set).

The values in training set are associated with the stated timestamp; the FeatureVector values are true as of this point in time.\n* These prediction values are accessible as soon as a data scientist defines a FeatureService.

Explore features from the Feature Library\n\nüîë **Concept: Feature Library**\n\nThe Feature Library includes all of your organization's registered features. Once a feature is registered with Tecton, Tecton manages the orchestration, storage, and serving of that feature. You can review overviews of all of your features' properties by clicking on the Features button in the Tecton Web UI. You can also access all of your registered features in Notebooks using the Tecton SDK.\n\nThese commands do two things:\n1.

To account for this, Tecton names registered features as FeaturePackages.\n* Using Tecton to register and manage your features allows for FeaturePackages to be reused and shared across your organization. \n* FeaturePackages have distinct names and be accessed via common methods. This allows for features to be referred to and used as objects of code."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó When determining which existing features to use for your model, the Tecton Web UI can help answer important questions, including:\n- Who created the feature, and when?\n- What is the source data for this feature - is it from batch, streaming, or request-time data?\n- What is the logic for the transformation?\n- What are some summary statistics associated with this feature?\n\nOnce you've completed this quickstart, we recommend you review the Web UI to get a sense of what information is available there."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Conclusion\n\nIn this walkthrough we:\n1.
