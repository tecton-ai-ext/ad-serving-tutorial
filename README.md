# Tecton's Ad Serving Tutorial
_Tecton's tutorial for using an Enterprise Feature Store._

Welcome to the Tecton Getting Started tutorial. In this tutorial, you will learn how an Enterprise Feature Store makes it easier to Define, Orchestrate, and Serve your machine learning features. We'll do this by quickly building a model using features developed by you and some fictional colleagues, and making predictions from that data that will be immediately available in production. 

The tutorial is focused on an ad serving - essentially, predicting which ad to show an individual based on their propensity to click on it. Ad serving models are good examples of what Tecton calls Operational ML - they are mission-critical, have stringent SLAs, and benefit from having very fresh features. The more recent the feature data is, the better. Recent context matters for a prediction.

Please reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss Enterprise Feature Stores at hello@tecton.ai. We would love to hear from you!
